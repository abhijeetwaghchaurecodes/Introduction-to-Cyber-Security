---ATTACKS---
We may face attacks from a wide variety of approaches and angles. When we look at what exactly makes up an attack, we can break it down according 
to the type of attack that it represents, the risk the attack represents, and the controls we might use to mitigate it.

--Types of Attacks--
Four categories: interception, interruption, modification, and fabrication.
[1] Interception
    Interception attacks allow unauthorized users to access our   data, applications, or environments, and are primarily  an attack against confidentiality.
    
[2] Interruption
    Interruption attacks cause our assets to become unusable or unavailable for our use, on a temporary or permanent basis.  
    Interruption attacks often affect availability but can be an attack on integrity as well. 
    
[3] Modification
    Modification attacks involve tampering with our asset. Such attacks might primarily be considered an integrity attack but 
    could also represent an availability attack.
    
[4] Fabrication
    Fabrication attacks involve generating data, processes, communications, or other similar activities with a system. Fabrication 
    attacks primarily affect integrity but could be considered an availability attack as well.
