---DEFENSE IN DEPTH---

Defense in depth is a strategy common to both military maneuvers and  information security.  In  both senses,   the  basic  concept of  defense in 
depth is to formulate a multilayered defense that  will  allow  us  to  still  mount a successful defense should one  or more of our  defensive measures 
fail.

One   important concept to note when planning a defensive strategy using defense in depth is that it is not a magic bullet. 
No matter how  many layers we put  in  place,  or  how  many defensive measures we  place  at each  layer, we  will not  be  able  to  keep  
every attacker out for  an  indefinite period of time,  nor  is this  the  ultimate goal  of  defense in  depth in  an  information  security setting. 
The  goal  is to  place  enough defensive measures between our  truly  important assets  and  the  attacker so  that we will both notice that  an attack  
is in progress and  also  buy  ourselves enough time  to  take  more  active  measures to  prevent the attack from  succeeding.
