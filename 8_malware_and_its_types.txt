---MALWARE AND IT'S TYPES---

Malware stands for “Malicious Software” and it is designed to gain access or installed into the computer without the consent of the user.
They perform unwanted tasks in the host computer for the benefit of a third party.There is a full range of malwares which can seriously degrade the performance of the host machine, 
which are simply written to distract/annoy the user.

SOME POPULAR TYPES ARE-
[1] ADWARE - It is a special type of malware which is used for forced advertising. They either redirect the page to some advertising page or pop-up an additional page which 
             promotes some product or event. These adware are financially supported by the organizations whose products are advertised.
             
[2] SPYWARE - It is a special type of which is installed in the target computer with or without the user permission and is designed to 
              steal sensitive information from the target machine.
              It can keeps track of the cookies of the host computer, it can act as a keyloggers to sniff the banking passwords and sensitive information, etc.
             
[3] BROWSER HIJACKING SOFTWARE - When we download some free softwares available on the internet, 
                                 This software modifies the browsers setting and redirect links to other unintentional sites.
                                 
[4] VIRUS - A virus is a malicious code written to damage/harm the host computer by deleting or appending a file, occupy memory space of the computer by replicating the copy of the code, 
            slow down the performance of the computer, format the host machine, etc.
            It can be spread via email attachment, pen drives, digital images, e-greeting, audio or video clips, etc. 
            Sometimes needs an (.exe) file to execute it.
            
[5] WORMS - They are a class of virus which can replicate themselves. They are different from the virus as they dont need any human intervention to operate.
            Worms can spread either through network, using the loopholes of the Operating System or via email. The replication and spreading of the worm over the network consumes 
            the network resources like space and bandwidth and force the network to choke.
            
[6] TROJAN HORSE - Trojan horse is a malicious code that is installed in the host machine by pretending to be useful software.
                   It not only damages the host computer by manipulating the data but also it creates a backdoor in the host computer so that it could be controlled by a remote computer. 
                   This remote controller can become a part of botnet (robot-network).
                   The computers of this network which are infected by malicious code are known as zombies. Trojens neither infect the other computers in the network nor do they replicate.
