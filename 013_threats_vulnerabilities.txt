---Threats, Vulnerabilities and Risks---

Threats
When we spoke of the  types of attacks we might encounter, in the  "Attacks"  earlier  in this chapter, we discussed some of the  things  that  
have the  potential to cause  harm  to our  assets. Ultimately, this is what a threat is-something that has the potential to cause us harm.

Risk
Risk is the likelihood that something bad will happen. In order for  us to  have a risk in  a particular environment, we need  to have  both a 
threat and  a vulnerability that  the  specific  threat can  exploit.

Impact
Some organizations, such as the U.S.  National  Security Agency  (NSA),  add an  additional factor  to  the  threat/vulnerability/risk equation, in  the  
form  of impact. If we consider the  value  of  the  asset  being threatened to  be  a factor, this  may  change whether we see  a risk  as 
being present or  not.
