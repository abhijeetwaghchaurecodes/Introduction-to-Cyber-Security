---INFORMATION PRIVACY AND ETHICS---

 --What is Privacy and Why is It Important?--
 the right to privacy is defined as the right of individuals to control access or interference by others into their private affairs.
 The right to privacy is not normally held to be absolute: it must be balanced against other rights and interests, such as the maintenance of 
 public order and national security. 
 
 --Information Technology and Privacy--
 Privacy is a value in modern societies that corresponds with the ideal of the autonomous individual who is free to act and decide his 
 own destiny. Yet, modern societies are also characterized by surveillance, a practice that tends to undermine privacy. 
 
 Corporations, for instance, have extended surveillance from the workplace to their customers (consumer surveillance). In addition, the 
 9/11 terrorist attacks have drastically expanded surveillance activities by the state. Many privacy disputes in today’s society result from tensions 
 between people’s right to privacy and state and corporate interests in surveillance. In the information society, privacy protection is realized 
 through all kinds of information privacy laws, policies and directives, or data protection policies, as they are often called in Europe. 
 These policies regulate the harvesting, processing, usage, storage and exchange of personal data.
