---CONTROLS---
categories: physical, logical and administrative

[1] Physical 
    Physical  controls are  those  controls that  protect the  physical  environment in which our  systems  sit or where  our  data  is stored. 
    Such controls also control access  in  and  out   of  such  environments. Physical  controls logically  include items   such   as  fences,  gates,  
    locks, bollards, guards,   and   cameras, but  also include systems  that  maintain the  physical  environment such  as heating and  air conditioning 
    systems, fire suppression systems, and  backup power generators.
    
[2] Logical
    Logical controls, sometimes called technical controls, are those   that   protect the systems, networks, and environments that process, 
    transmit and store our data.
    
[3] Administrative 
    Administrative controls are based on rules, laws, policies, procedures, guidelines, and other items that are â€œpaper" in nature. In  essence,   
    administrative controls set out  the  rules  for  how  we expect  the  users  of our  environment to behave.
