---APPLICATIONS OF INTERNET---

Internet have become an essential component of our daily lives. But what does one do with the Internet? May be four things, basically: mail, discussion groups, long-distance computing, and file transfers.

Long-distance computing was an original inspiration for development of ARPANET and does still provide a very useful service on Internet.

Programmers can maintain accounts on distant, powerful computers, execute programs. File transfer service allows Internet users to access remote machines and retrieve programs, data or text.
